# Instructions

* Open the file, `cereal.csv` and start by skipping the header row. See hints below for this.

* Read through the remaining rows and find the cereals that contain five grams of fiber or more, printing the data from those rows to the terminal.

## Hint

* Everything within the csv is stored as a string and certain rows have a decimal. This means that they will have to be cast to be used.

* The csv.Reader begins reading the csv file at the first row. `next(csv_reader, None)` will skip the header row. Refer to this stackoverflow answer on [how to skip the header](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14257599) for more information.

* Integers in Python are whole numbers and, as such, cannot contain decimals. As such, your numbers containing decimal points will have to be cast as a `float.

## Bonus

* Try the following again but this time using `cereal_bonus.csv`, which does not include a header.
